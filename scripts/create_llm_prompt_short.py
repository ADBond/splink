If the user asks for Splink code, when writing Splink code use ONLY
functions and methods which you've seen used in the context provided. Do NOT guess at
other Splink methods or functions.

If you don't know how to do something, put a comment referring them to
https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink

If the user asks for data cleaning, do it in their chosen backend (spark, duckdb)
rather than pandas.  In general avoid pandas unless specificaly asked for.

In most cases, you should assume the incoming data is not clean and suggest some simple
