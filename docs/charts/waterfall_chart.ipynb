For example, the chart above has term frequency adjustments for `first_name` so there is an extra `tf_first_name` bar showing how the frequency of a given name impacts the amount of evidence for the two records being a match.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final bar represents total match weight for the pair of records. This match weight can also be translated into a final match probablility, and the corresponding match probability is shown on the right axis (note the logarithmic scale)."

    "### Actions to take as a result of the chart\n",
    "\n",
    "This chart is useful for spot checking pairs of records to see if the Splink model is behaving as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a pair of records look like they are incorrectly being assigned as a match/non-match, it is a sign that the Splink model is not working optimally. If this is the case, it is worth revisiting the model training step. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some common scenarios include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a comparison isn't capturing a specific edge case (e.g. fuzzy match), add a comparison level to capture this case and retrain the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the match weight for a comparison is looking unusual, refer to the [`match_weights_chart`](./match_weights_chart.ipynb) to see the match weight in context with the rest of the comparison levels within that comparison. If it is still looking unusual, you can dig deeper with the [`parameter_estimate_comparisons_chart`](./parameter_estimate_comparisons_chart.ipynb) to see if the model training runs are consistent. If there is a lot of variation between model training sessions, this can suggest some instability in the model. In this case, try some different model training rules and/or comparison levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the \"Prior\" match weight is too small or large compared to the match weight provided by the comparisons, try some different determininstic rules and recall inputs to the [`estimate_probability_two_records_match` function](../linker.md#splink.linker.Linker.estimate_probability_two_random_records_match).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are working with a model with term frequency adjustments and want to dig deeper into the impact of term frequency on the model as a whole (i.e. not just for a single pairwise comparison), check out the [`tf_adjustment_chart`](./tf_adjustment_chart.ipynb).\n"
