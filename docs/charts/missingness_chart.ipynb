This is because there will be so many cases where at least one of the records in any pairwise comparison has a missing value that few will actually get scored by the model. If it is a particularly strong identifier (e.g. National Insurance Number, Social Security Number) it can still be worth including a column with high missingness in your model.\n",

    "In cases with particularly high missingness there is a risk that there will not be sufficient pairwise examples to train the Splink model. In this case, it is generally advised to  remove the column from the model comparisons."
