    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- the data quality is low enough such that a significant proportion of records are unable to be linked to themselves\n",
    "- the parameters of the Splink model are such that features have not been assigned enough weight, and therefore will not perform well\n",
    "\n",
    "This chart also gives an indication of the number of False Negatives (i.e. missed links) at a given threshold, assuming sufficient data quality. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- we know that a record should be linked to itself, so seeing that a match weight $\\approx$ 10 gives 16% of records unable to link to themselves\n",
    "- exact matches generally provide the strongest matches, therefore, we can expect that any \"fuzzy\" matches to have lower match scores. As a result, we can deduce that the propoertion of False Negatives will be higher than 16%.\n"
