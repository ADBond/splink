    "### Actions to take as a result of the chart\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the `match_weights_chart`, one of the most effective methods to assess a Splink model is to walk through each of the comparison levels of the `m_u_parameters_chart` and sense check the m and u probabilities that have been allocated by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for all non-matching pairwise comparisons (which form the vast majority of all pairwise comparisons), it makes sense that the exact match and fuzzy levels occur very rarely. Furthermore, `dob` and `city` are lower cardinality features (i.e. have fewer possible values) than names so \"All other comparisons\" is less likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are any m or u values that appear unusual, check out the values generated for each training session in the [`parameter_estimate_comparisons_chart`](./parameter_estimate_comparisons_chart.ipynb)."
