    "### How to interpret the chart\n",
    "\n",
    "Each bar in the `match_weights_chart` shows the evidence of a match provided by each level in a Splink model (i.e. match weight). As such, the match weight chart provides a summary for the entire Splink model, as it shows the match weights for every type of comparison defined within the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any Splink score generated to compare two records will add up the evidence (i.e. match weights) for each comparison to come up with a final match weight score, which can then be converted into a probability of a match.\n",

    "\n",

    "Some heuristics to help assess Splink models with the `match_weights_chart`:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Match weights gradually reducing within a comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison levels are order dependent, therefore they are constructed that the most \"similar\" levels come first and get gradually less \"similar\". As a result, we would generally expect that match weight will reduce as we go down the levels in a comparison. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Very similar comparison levels\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparisons are broken up into comparison levels to show different levels of similarity between records. As these levels are associated with different levels of similarity, we expect the amount of evidence (i.e. match weight) to vary between comparison levels. Two levels with the same match weight does not provide the model with any additional information which could make it perform better. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if two levels of a comparison return the same match weight, these should be combined into a single level.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Very different comparison levels\n",
    "\n",
    "Levels that have a large variation between comparison levels have a significant impact on the model results. For example, looking at the `email` comparison in the chart above, the difference in match weight between an exact/fuzzy match and \"All other comparisons\" is > 13, which is quite extreme. This generally happens with highly predictive features (e.g. email, national insurance number, social security number).\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are a number of highly predictive features, it is worth looking at simplifying your model using these more predictive features. In some cases, similar results may be obtained with a [deterministic](../topic_guides/theory/probabilistic_vs_deterministic.md) rather than a probabilistic linkage model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logical Walk-through\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most effective methods to assess a splink model is to walk through each of the comparison levels of the `match_weights_chart` and sense check the amount of evidence (i.e. match weight) that has been allocated by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the chart above, we would expect records with the same `dob` to provide more evidence of a match that `first_name` or `surname`. Conversely, given how people can move location, we would expect that `city` would be less predictive than people's fixed, personally identifying characteristics like `surname`, `dob` etc.\n",
