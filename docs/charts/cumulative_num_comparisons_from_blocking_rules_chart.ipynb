The number of comparisons is the main primary driver of the amount of computational resource required for Splink model training, predictions etc. (i.e. how long things will take to run). \n",
    "\n",
    "The number of comparisons that are appropriate for a model varies. In general, if a model is taking hours to run (unless you are working with 100+ million records), it could be helpful to reduce the number of comparisons by defining more restrictive blocking rules. \n",
