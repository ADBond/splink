# Cluster Evaluation

Graphs provide a natural way to think about linked data (see [link to intro page] for a refresher). Visualising linked data as a graph and employing graph metrics are powerful ways to evaluate linkage quality.

Graph metrics help to give a big-picture view of the clusters generated by a Splink model. Through metric distributions and statistics, we can gauge the quality of clusters and monitor how adjustments to models impact results.
<!-- Insights gained can be used to refine linking strategies, leading to more accurate predictions. -->

Graph metrics can also help us home in on problematic clusters, such as those containing inaccurate links (false positives). Clusters can be spot-checked with Splinkâ€™s [Cluster Studio Dashboard]() which enables users to visualise individual clusters and interrogate the links between their member records.

<!-- For example, the distribution of cluster sizes can reveal outliers, such as very large clusters, that may require closer examination. -->
<!-- For example, the 'is bridge' metric (see below/name of section) can be a signaller of false positives.  -->

## Evaluating cluster quality

### What is a high quality cluster?
When it comes to data linking, the highest quality clusters will be those containing all possible true matches (no false negatives) and no false matches (no false positives).
This idealised situation is rarely realised in practice, at least not across all clusters generated.
Blocking rules, necessary to make computations tractable, can prevent record comparisons between some true matches ever being made. Limitations of data and on resources can place an upper limit on the level of quality possible to achieve.
However, graph metrics can help us get closer to a satisfactory level of quality and monitor it going forward.

### What does good look like for you?

The extent of cluster evaluation efforts and what is considered good enough will vary greatly with linkage use case. 

Might have a gold standard or labeled data or other model you want to be just as good as...which gives a clear something to aim towards.

It can be difficult to make a judgement on quality without prior...

Using domain knowledge can help set expectations of what is reasonable to expect. For example,...

This guide is intended to help users to obtain a better understanding of better understand the over all shape, build up an idea of their clusters, identify potential problematic clusters, where to target their efforts, regardless of prior knowledge.
And in that way can create an expectation/baseline of what good looks like.
