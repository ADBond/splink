# Edge Evaluation

Once you have a trained model, you use it to generate edges (links) between entities (nodes). These edges will have a Match Weight and corresponding Probability.

There are two distinct types of Edge Evaluation that should be considered at this stage:

1. Overall Metrics
2. Spot checking

with the insights from both of these feeding into Threshold Selection ahead of of the Clustering stage.

## Overall Metrics

For a rundown of all the overall metrics available in Splink, check out the [metrics guide](./edge_metrics.md). These metrics required a "ground truth" to compare against which can be achieved by Clerical Labelling.

## Spot Checking



## Threshold Selection
