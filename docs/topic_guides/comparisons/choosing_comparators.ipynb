    "# Choosing String Comparators\n",
    "\n",
    "When building a Splink model, one of the most important aspects is defining the [`Comparisons`](../../comparison.md) and [`Comparison Levels`](../../comparison_level.md) that the model will train on. Each `Comparison Level` within a `Comparison` should contain a different amount of evidence that two records are a match, which the model can assign a Match Weight to. When considering different amounts of evidence for the model, it is helpful to explore fuzzy matching as a way of distinguishing strings that are similar, but not the same, as one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide is intended to show how Splink's string comparators perform in different situations in order to help choosing the most appropriate comparator for a given column as well as the most appropriate threshold (or thresholds).\n",

    "## What options are available when comparing strings?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main classes of string comparator that are considered within Splink:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **String Similarity Scores**  \n",
    "2. **String Distance Scores**  \n",
    "3. **Phonetic Matching**  \n",
    "\n",
    "where  \n",
    "\n",
    "**String Similarity Scores** are scores between 0 and 1 indicating how similar two strings are. 0 represents two completely dissimilar strings and 1 represents identical strings. E.g. [Jaro-Winkler Similarity](comparators.md#jaro-winkler-similarity).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**String Distance Scores** are integer distances, counting the number of operations to convert one string into another. A lower string distance indicates more similar strings. E.g. [Levenshtein Distance](comparators.md#levenshtein-distance).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Phonetic Matching** is whether two strings are phonetically similar. The two strings are passed through a [phonetic transformation algorithm](phonetic.md) and then the resulting phonetic codes are matched. E.g. [Double Metaphone](phonetic.md#double-metaphone)."
