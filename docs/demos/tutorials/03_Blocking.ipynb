    "To link records, we need to compare pairs of records, and decide which pairs are matches and non matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example consider the following two records:\n",
    "\n",
    "| first_name | surname | dob        | city   | email               |\n",

    "For most large datasets, it is computationally intractable to compare every row with every other row, since the number of comparisons rises quadratically with the number of records.\n",

    "\n",

    "## Blocking rules in Splink\n",
    "\n",
    "In Splink, blocking rules are specified as SQL expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to generate the subset of record comparisons where the first name and surname matches, we can specify the following blocking rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from splink.blocking_rule_library import block_on\n",
    "block_on(\"first_name\", \"surname\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When executed, this blocking rule will be converted to a SQL statement with the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT ...\n",
    "FROM input_tables as l\n",
    "INNER jOIN input_tables as r\n",
    "ON l.first_name = r.first_name AND l.surname = r.surname\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since blocking rules are SQL expressions, they can be arbitrarily complex. For example, you could create record comparisons where the initial of the first name and the surname match with the following rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from splink.blocking_rule_library import block_on\n",
    "block_on(\"substr(first_name, 1, 2)\", \"surname\")\n",

    "## Devising effective blocking rules for prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "The aims of your blocking rules are twofold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Eliminate enough non-matching comparison pairs so your record linkage job is small enough to compute\n",
    "2. Eliminate as few truly matching pairs as possible (ideally none)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is usually impossible to find a single blocking rule which achieves both aims, so we recommend using multiple blocking rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we specify multiple blocking rules, Splink will generate all comparison pairs that meet any one of the rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following blocking rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "`block_on(\"first_name\", \"dob\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "This rule is likely to be effective in reducing the number of comparison pairs. It will retain all truly matching pairs, except those with errors or nulls in either the `first_name` or `dob` fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider a second blocking rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "`block_on(\"email\")`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will retain all truly matching pairs, except those with errors or nulls in the `email` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Individually, these blocking rules are problematic because they exclude true matches where the records contain typos of certain types. But between them, they might do quite a good job.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a true match to be eliminated by the use of these two blocking rules, it would have to have an error in _both_ `email` AND (`first_name` or `dob`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not completely implausible, but it is significantly less likely than if we'd used a single rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, we can often specify multiple blocking rules such that it becomes highly implausible that a true match would not meet at least one of these blocking criteria. This is the recommended approach in Splink. Generally we would recommend between about 3 and 10, though even more is possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question then becomes how to choose what to put in this list.\n"
