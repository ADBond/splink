# Splink 3 updates, and Splink 4 development announcement - March 2024

This post describes significant updates to Splink since our previous [post](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/blog/2023/12/06/splink-updates---december-2023.html) and details of development work taking place on the forthcoming Splink 4 release.

!!! warning

    Splink 3 has entered maintenance mode.  We will continue to apply bugfixes, but new features should be built on the [splink4_dev](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink/tree/splink4_dev) branch.  We are no longer accepting new features on the master (Splink 3) branch.

## Splink 3 Updates

Here are some highlights of Splink development since our [last update](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/blog/2023/12/06/splink-updates---december-2023.html) in December 2023. As always, keep an eye on the [changelog](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more regular updates.

### Graph metrics

Graph metrics are important in record linkage because they can give insights into the quality of your linking model. They are particularly relevant to the analysis of [clusters](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/linker.html?h=graph#splink.linker.Linker.cluster_pairwise_predictions_at_threshold).

For example, a cluster where all entities are connected to all others with high match weights is likely to be more reliable than a cluster where many of the entities connect to only a small proportion of the other entities in the cluster. This can be measured by a graph metric called density.

Several graph metrics can now be computed using [`linker.compute_graph_metrics`](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/linker.html?h=graph#splink.linker.Linker.compute_graph_metrics).

### DuckDB Performance Improvements and Benchmarking

The DuckDB backend is [now fully parallelised,](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink/pull/1796) resulting in large performance increases especially on high core count machines.

We [now](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink/commit/0f1a87a7917051e55af3d7d11379736abe94787a) recommend the DuckDB backend for most users. It is the fastest backend, and is capable of linking large datasets, especially if you have access to high-spec machines.

For the first time, we have also conducted formal benchmarking of DuckDB on machines of different sizes. A blog post with the results can be found [here](https://www.robinlinacre.com/fast_deduplication/).

### Blocking on an array column

In some circumstances, it is useful to block on an array column. For example, if a persons have an array (list) of postcodes associated with each record, then we may wish to generate all record comparisons where there is a match of at least one postcode (the union of the arrays is of length 1 or more). This feature was added in [PR 1692](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink/pull/1692), with thanks to Github user `nerskin` for this external contribution!

## Splink 4

The team has been focussing development efforts on [Splink 4](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink/tree/splink4_dev), due to be released sometime this year.

We’re pleased to announce we’ve recently reached an important milestone: all tests are passing, and all of the tutorial and examples notebooks have been updated and work successfully in the new version

Development releases of Splink 4 have commenced, and you can try it out using `pip install --pre splink`, or try it out in your web browser using the Colab links at the top the [tutorial](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink/tree/splink4_dev/docs/demos/tutorials) and [example](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink/tree/splink4_dev/docs/demos/examples/duckdb) notebooks.

As a result, Splink 3 has entered maintenance mode. We will continue to apply bugfixes, but new features should be built on the [splink4_dev](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink/tree/splink4_dev) branch. We are no longer accepting new features on the master (Splink 3) branch.

### Aims of Splink 4

Splink 4 represents an incremental improvement to version 3 that makes Splink easier to use without making any major changes to workflows. The core functionality has not changed - the steps to train a model and predict results are the same, and models trained in Splink 3 will still work in Splink 4.

#### Improve ease of use

The primary aim is to improve the user-facing API so that:

- The user has to write less code to achieve the same result
- Function imports are simpler and grouped more intuitively
- Settings and configuration can now be constructed entirely using Python objects, meaning that the user can rely heavily on autocomplete, rather than needing to remember the names of settings.
- Less dialect-specific code

You can see an example of how the code changes between version 3 and 4 in the screenshot below:

The corresponding code is [here](https://gist.github.com/RobinL/c99712c1fb0b6c80593b5028c0be553a).

#### Improve ease of development

A second important aim of Splink 4 is to improve the internal codebase to make Splink easier to develop for the core team and external contributors. These changes don’t affect the end user, but should enable a faster pace of development.

A wide range of improvements have been made such as:

- Code quality: type hinting, mypy conformance etc.
- CI much faster
- Reducing rigidities in dependencies
- Decoupling parts of the codebase and less mutable state

### Timelines

We expect to do regular beta releases to pypi in the coming months. They can be found [here](https://pypi.org/project/splink/#history), and you can install the latest version of Splink 4 using `pip install --pre splink`

!!! warning

    During this time, there may be further breaking changes to the public API so please use Splink 4 with caution. However, we think the new API is now relatively stable, and big changes are unlikely.

We expect to bring Splink 4 out of beta, and do a first full release sometime in autumn.

### Feedback

We welcome feedback on Splink 4. The best way to get in contact is via our [discussion forum](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink/discussions).
