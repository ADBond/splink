# Bias in Data Linking

In March 2024, the Splink team launched a six-month _'Bias in Data Linking'_ internship with the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk). This installment of the Splink Blog is going to introduce the internship, its goals, and provide an update on what's happened so far.

The internship is being undertaken by myself, Erica Kane. I am a PhD student based at the University of Leeds. My doctoral research is in Data Analytics, conducted in partnership with the Parole Board. I have a background in quantitative research within Criminal Justice.

## üìù Background

The internship stemmed from the team's [previous engagement with ethics](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/blog/2024/01/23/ethics-in-data-linking.html), understanding that this complex yet inevitable aspect of data science has implications for data linking. 

Data science pipelines are intricate processes with lots of decision points. At each of these decision points bias can creep in. If it does, its impact on results can vary as it interacts with different parts of the pipeline. For example, two datasets might react differently to the same bias introduced by a model. Additionally, multiple biases can interact with each other, making it difficult to see their individual effects. Therefore, detecting, monitoring, quantifying, and mitigating bias in data science pipelines is extremely challenging.

## üéØ Goals

To set the direction for the internship, it was useful to first define what a successful outcome would look like. 

Many users and developers of data linking pipelines have ideas about where bias _might_ be entering their pipeline, but they aren‚Äôt always sure _how_ to evaluate this bias or understand its impact. So, the goal was to create a **standardised framework for evaluating bias** that‚Äôs structured in approach but adaptable to different use cases.

Before developing this framework, it was useful to look at different types and sources of bias in data linking pipelines. This helped provide real-life examples, so assessing the suitability of an evaluation method had practical context.

## üîç Sources of bias

From talking with experts and reviewing relevant materials, it was clear that there were already hypotheses about where bias might enter a data linking pipeline. 

These hypotheses were reviewed and grouped into broad categories, highlighting the key areas for evaluation:

The **input data** can contain mistakes or legitimate qualities which make some records harder to link than others. Addressing these mistakes or qualities through data preparation techniques can have the same effect. If this impact is not random, this means the input data will introduce bias.

**Model design** involves specifying settings that define which records to compare and how to compare them. If these design choices result in a better/worse performance for certain record types, bias will be introduced.

Understanding these potential bias sources laid the groundwork for determining the most suitable evaluation method, providing examples of the types of issues that needed to be assessed.

## üìä Evaluating bias 

There are many ways to evaluate performance in data science, and a common approach is to create labelled data to assess model outcomes. In data linking, this means manually labelling comparisons as "link" or "non-link," running them through the pipeline, and then comparing the predicted results to these labels.

This method can provide a general overview of performance. However, a more focussed approach is needed for assessing bias within the framework. To do this, it's important to identify specific records that align with the defined hypothesis. These might include records that represent mistakes, qualities, or preparation of the input data, or those affected by model design settings.

This method involves a three-step process:

Each step was reviewed to understand the considerations for evaluating bias...

### **Step 1: Hand label record comparisons**

Firstly, records are labelled by human experts to decide if they relate to the same person, creating a 'true' sample of comparisons. This sample provides the base from which performance is assessed.

When working with real data, it's not always clear whether records relate to the same individual...

It can be difficult for even human evaluators to make these decisions, resulting in a lack of ground truth in the labels. In making this decision, further bias can be introduced. 

### **Step 2: Identify records**

The second step is to focus the evaluation on bias by identifying records that represent the specific hypothesis. Issues with this process are demonstrated by the following example:

_Bias is suspected enter a pipeline through data standardisation using an English trained phonetic algorithm. Records with non-English phonetic names must be identified for evaluation. There are two main options to identify these records..._

1. Using variables as proxies
    - Relies on accurate recording of the variable (e.g. ethnicity/nationality)
    - Assumes a relationship between the variable and name phonetics  
2. Direct identification
    - Relies on assumptions regarding name phonetic origin
    - Requires complex technical solution which would be difficult to develop and verify

Although these issues are illustrated through the provided example, they are applicable to most hypotheses. Both options are likely to introduce additional bias.

### **Step 3: Assess the performance**

The final step is to assess performance outcomes by comparing the labelled data with the pipeline‚Äôs predictions. In bias evaluation, understanding where the model goes wrong is of particular interest (false positives and false negatives). 

A high-level typical data linking performance may look like this:

![Image 4](./img/confusion_matrix_1.png)

This represents the reality of the dominant class (non-links) in data linking, as most records which are compared will not relate to the same individual. This leaves very few errors to evaluate within a large sample of labels. When analysing for bias, the focus would be on an even smaller subset of records of interest. 

A bias specific data linking performance may look like this:

![Image 5](./img/confusion_matrix_2.png)

This further reduces the absolute number of examples, making it difficult to decide if there is bias and quantify its impact. 

Getting enough useful examples is possible, but impractical. It would require either dedicating a lot of resources to labelling or using a sampling method that could introduce bias.

## üí° Conclusions 

The internship aims to develop a framework that helps users of data linking pipelines assess suspected bias. This first blog covers the initial steps taken to figure out what the evaluation process might look like.

Looking into how a common evaluation approach handles bias investigation in data linking uncovered three main issues:

1. There is no 'ground truth' in labelling.
2. Records of interest are difficult to identify.
3. Gathering large samples of FPs and FNs is impractical.

These challenges stem from working with real data and make this method unsuitable for the framework. We‚Äôre now looking into alternative evaluation approaches to develop the framework ‚Äî **stay tuned for updates!**
